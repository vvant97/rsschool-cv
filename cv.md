## About Myself

I have a huge marketing experience and I lead an E-commerce project now. However, I want to become a Frontend Developer, because now I realize that I really passionate about this profession. I'm crazy about learning new technologies and trying to create some web applications from scratch, but I admit that I have not enough skills to create something really great. I definitely admire projects that professional web developers can do and it's one of the reasons that drives me on my dev way.

> I wish myself and everyone to be passionate about learning programming and keep going!
